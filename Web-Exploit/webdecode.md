# Description
Do you know how to use the web inspector?

# Hint
 - Use the web inspector on other files included by the web page. 
 - The flag may or may not be encoded

# Solution
Letâ€™s follow the hints to find the flag in the web page.
1. Open the browser's web inspector.
2. Look at all the files lo aded by the page, such as JavaScript, CSS, or other resources.
3. Navigate through different tabs. You might notice the text:
> "Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there"

Just below that text, you might find an encoded string like this:
<pre>notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMjgzZTYyZmV9"</pre>

4. This looks like a Base64-encoded flag. To decode it:
- Go to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)
- Paste the encoded string into the Input section.
- Drag and drop the operation "From Base64" into the Recipe section.
- The decoded flag will appear in the Output section.
