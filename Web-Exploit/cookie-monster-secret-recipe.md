# Description
Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?

# Hint
Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.

#Solution:

Letâ€™s dig into this delicious mystery:
1. Open **dev tools**.
2. Head over to the **Storage** tab â†’ then select **Cookies**.
3. Look through the list of cookies. One of them might have a strange value like:
> cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0RFN0E1RTc2fQ%3D%3D

4. Hmm... suspicious! ðŸ¤” Looks like it's encoded â€” letâ€™s decode it step-by-step:
Looks like Base64, but wait â€” the `%3D%3D` at the end?  
Thatâ€™s not part of Base64 â€“ itâ€™s URL-encoded (`%3D` = `=`)!

Letâ€™s clean it up first:
Replace `%3D%3D` with `==`, like this:
> cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0RFN0E1RTc2fQ==

Then decode it in Git Bash:
<pre> echo cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0RFN0E1RTc2fQ%3D%3D | base64 -d </pre>

Besides that, you can also use CyberChef to decode it easily! ðŸŽ‰
